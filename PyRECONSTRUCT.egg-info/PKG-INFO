        ** THIS DISTRIBUTION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, BUGS ARE LIKELY TO EXIST **
        
        PyRECONSTRUCT provides easy access to XML files associated with the program RECONSTRUCT.
        This package should also be used to develop scripts/programs for various tasks that use
        these XML files. Included examples are mergeTool for merging multiple RECONSTRUCT series
        and excelTool for pushing object data into an excel workbook (.xlsx).
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        INSTALLATION
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        PyRECONSTRUCT can be installed in multiple ways:
        	
        	The easiest being through pip*:
        		pip install PyRECONSTRUCT
        	
        	Alternatively (from parent folder):
        		python setup.py install
        	
        	*this method can have problems. Specifically, prerequisite packages may not install correctly
        	on their own and will interrupt the PyRECONSTRUCT installation
        
        These dependencies are required to run on a linux system (currently working to get functionality on Windows):
        	python-dev
        	python-setuptools
        	libgeos-dev
        	libblas-dev
        	liblapack-dev
        	libfreetype6-dev
        	libpng-dev
        	gfortran
        	libxml2-dev
        	libxslt-dev
        	cmake
        	libshiboken-dev
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        IMPORTING INTO PYTHON
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        PyRECONSTRUCT should be imported with the name 'pyrecon' (i.e. import pyrecon)
        
        To import only the XML-parse portion of PyRECONSTRUCT:
        	
        	from pyrecon.tools import classes
        		or
        	from pyrecon.tool.classes import * 
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
