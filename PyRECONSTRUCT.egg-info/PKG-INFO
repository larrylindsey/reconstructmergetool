        PyRECONSTRUCT provides easy access to XML files associated with the program RECONSTRUCT.
        This package should also be used to develop scripts/programs for various tasks that use
        these XML files. Included examples are mergeTool for merging multiple RECONSTRUCT series
        and excelTool for pushing object data into an excel workbook (.xlsx).

        INSTALLATION (Linux and Windows)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Linux :D
        -------------
        PyRECONSTRUCT can be installed in multiple ways:
        	
        	The easiest being through pip*:
        		pip install PyRECONSTRUCT
        	
        	Alternatively (from parent folder):
        		python setup.py install
        	
        	*this method can have problems. Specifically, prerequisite packages may not install correctly
        	on their own and will interrupt the PyRECONSTRUCT installation
        
        These dependencies are required to run on a linux system (currently working to get functionality on Windows):
        	python-dev
        	python-setuptools
        	libgeos-dev
        	libblas-dev
        	liblapack-dev
        	libfreetype6-dev
        	libpng-dev
        	gfortran
        	libxml2-dev
        	libxslt-dev
        	cmake
        	libshiboken-dev
        
        # Windows :(
        -------------
        PyRECONSTRUCT for Windows has only been tested using the following method:
        1. Download and install Python2.7:
        	http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/
        2. Download and install python-setuptools (setup.py install):
        	http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
        3. Download PyRECONSTRUCT code from pypi:
        	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyRECONSTRUCT
        4. Run 'setup.py install' after cding into parent folder
        	*This will be unsuccessful due to missing dependencies, but it will tell you why. This will most likely be resolved in the following steps, but rerun this command after every step to determine if problems are being resolved successfully 
        5. Download and install lxml (includes libxml2/libxslt):
        	https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-3.2.3.win-amd64-py2.7.exe#md5=3720e7d124275b728f553eb93831869c
        6. Download and install Cython:
        	http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cython
        7. Download and install Scipy-stack:
        	http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy-stack
        8. Download and install scikit-image:
        	http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scikit-image
        9. Download and install scipy (fixes missing scipy.special package):
        	http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy
        10. ...Should work now?

        IMPORTING INTO PYTHON
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        PyRECONSTRUCT should be imported with the name 'pyrecon' (i.e. import pyrecon)
        
        To import only the XML-parse portion of PyRECONSTRUCT:
        	
        	from pyrecon.tools import classes
        		or
        	from pyrecon.tool.classes import * 
        
        
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
