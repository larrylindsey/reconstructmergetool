        PyRECONSTRUCT provides easy access to XML files associated with the program RECONSTRUCT.
        This package should also be used to develop scripts/programs for various tasks that use
        these XML files. Included examples are mergeTool for merging multiple RECONSTRUCT series
        and excelTool for pushing object data into an excel workbook (.xlsx).
        
        The gui for mergeTool is still under construction... please be patient!
        
        PyRECONSTRUCT should be imported with the name 'pyrecon' (i.e. import pyrecon)
        
        To import only the XML-parse portion of PyRECONSTRUCT:
        	from pyrecon.tools import classes
        		or
        	from pyrecon.tool.classes import *
